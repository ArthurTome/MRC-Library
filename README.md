### Activities done and new tasks scheduled until next meeting
1. Still not finished reading of chapter 4
2. Discussion about the SoS model
3. For the next meeting an SoS initial class should be presented

## 2022-09-15
### Activities done and new tasks scheduled until next meeting
1. An initial SoS code was presented, but requires corrections
2. After the correction, a version of the estimateModel (e.g., MED) should be implemented and presented in the next meeting
3. The corrections include replacing raw pointers by smart pointers 
4. Two versions of the calcProcess function should also be implemented until next meeting
